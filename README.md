# Low-Level Design (LLD) Repository

Welcome to the **Low-Level Design (LLD)** repository. This repository contains various low-level system design problems and their solutions, implemented in **Java**.

## Overview

Low-Level Design focuses on the detailed design of individual components of a system, including class diagrams, interactions, object-oriented design principles, and design patterns. In this repository, you will find:

- Problem statements
- Design solutions
- Class diagrams
- Code implementations in **Java**

## Introduction

This repository is intended to help developers, students, and engineers understand and implement Low-Level Design concepts, emphasizing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and design patterns, using **Java** as the programming language.

## Design Principles

We adhere to key OOP and software design principles, including:
- **SOLID Principles**
- **DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)**
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**
- **YAGNI (You Aren’t Gonna Need It)**

## Design Patterns

In this repository, you will find **Java** implementations of various design patterns like:
- **Creational Patterns** (e.g., Singleton, Factory)
- **Structural Patterns** (e.g., Adapter, Facade)
- **Behavioral Patterns** (e.g., Observer, Strategy)

## Implemented Systems

Here are some system design examples and solutions included in the repository, implemented in **Java**:
- **Ride-Sharing System**
- **Hotel Booking System**
- **Food Delivery System**
- **Parking Lot System**
